                        <h2>Python</h2>
                        Python learning
                        It is a clear and legible language which facilitates work and learning for beginners.
                        Python ranks 2nd on the list of the best programming languages, which is another strong argument!
                        The biggest platforms like Spotify, Netflix, Dropbox, Youtube uses this language, and that even makes me more excited to start with it!
                        Programming in Python has many possibilities and applications: Arduino or Raspberry Pi, Cybersecurity, IoT, Marketing (information analysis), Statistics, Machine Learning, AI and Web development.
                        To start this project I just needed Django (Framework) which Python offers. Thanks to this, I started my first real project! When I was coming to finishing writing Backend I understand that I have to start learning and writing basics in HTML5 to get visual output of my job.

                        <h2>HTML 5</h2>
                        <p>What exactly is HTML5? HyperText Markup Language is a so-called hypertext language that describes the contents of the document format, such as a font or paragraph.
                            HTML is used when creating websites. HTML has a so-called skeleton. Thanks to which the order of information and composition of our site should always be the same.
                            When all information and data are applied in our website we need to take care of appearance. In my case I used Bootstrap 4 which is the best framework in my opinion to help you with design!

                        <h2>Bootstrap 4</h2>
                        <p>Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating a websites and web applications.
                            It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.
                            The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project.
                            As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements.

                        <h2>Youtube</h2>
                        It seems to me that without youtube I would not have reached this level so quickly and wouldn't be proud of my project.
                        Thanks to a lot of information I learned in and gained from instructional videos, tutorials how to start programming in Python and how to use Django.
                        I decided to write my first project from scratch.
                        <p>The below channels helped me a lot and were crucial for me:</p>

                        <p>Internet search engine created by the American company Google Inc. Its purpose is to catalog all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
                            Thanks to google I was able to search all the information, when I didn't know how to write the code correctly or I lacked knowledge.
                            Using Google is necessary and very simple, it brings a quick and the accurate answers.Community of programmers who are helping and guiding is very rich, thats why google is so powerful tool.<br>
